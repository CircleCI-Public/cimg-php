docker-php-ext-configure:
- changed the directory path to match what the corresponding directory is in cimg-php
- find command has comments in line along with non-fatal error

docker-php-ext-install:
- same changes as configure

docker-php-ext-enable:
- no changes

docker-php-soure:
- edited the directory
- edited lines 18-25 to download the php source tarball

install-php-extensions:
- most changes are directory changes; e.g lines 
2045-2046
2175-2176
2203-2209
3603-3604
<!-- # cd /usr/src/php/ext/odbc
cd /usr/local/lib/php/extensions/odbc -->

since the directories are not the same as the default docker image from php, i had to change some of the directories. i am able to download with the command e.g `sudo install-php-extensions xdebug`, but once the download is complete, a couple things happen: i get the error saying there is a missing operand, and the next steps in mlocati's script do not execute for some reason, saying that the PHP_INI_DIR, a variable that is defined in the dockerfile and also can be echoed.

when I checked the extensions folder at `/usr/local/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20210902`, i can see that the .so files are downloaded and exist. however, i am unable to unpack them. Lastly, there are quite a few times conf.d comes up as well as ini files. While I can't find conf.d anywhere in cimg-php, i was able to check using php -i and php -m to confirm that the ini file we ultimately are using is circleci.ini. however, i don't believe other ini files exist
